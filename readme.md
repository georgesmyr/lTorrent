## Bitfield

A bitfield is a data structure used in programming to efficiently store and manipulate a set of binary flags or bit values. It is typically used to represent multiple boolean variables or small integer values compactly within a single integer or a sequence of bytes. Each bit in the bitfield represents a different flag or value, allowing for the efficient use of memory and enabling fast bitwise operations.
